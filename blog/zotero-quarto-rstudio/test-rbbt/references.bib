  abstract = {The use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by purse seine fisheries has come under increasing criticism for its potential deleterious impacts on tuna stocks, for high levels of by-catch and threats to the biodiversity of tropical pelagic ecosystems. Here, we review the current state of scientific knowledge of this fishing technique and current management strategies. Our intent is to encourage objective discussion of the topic and highlight areas worthy of future research. We show that catching juvenile tuna around FADs does not necessarily result in overfishing of stocks, although more selective fishing techniques would likely help obtain higher yield. Levels of non-tuna by-catch are comparable to or less than in other commercial tuna fisheries and are primarily comprised of species that are not considered threatened. Accordingly, to minimize impacts on ecosystem balance, there is merit in considering that all species captured in purse seine fisheries (excluding vulnerable species such as turtles and sharks) should be retained, but the consequences of such a measure should be carefully examined before implementation. The take of vulnerable species could be further reduced by introduction of additional mitigation measures, but their potential benefits would be limited without parallel efforts with other gears. Finally, there is no unequivocal empirical evidence that FADs represent an ‘ecological trap’ that inherently disrupts tuna biology although further research should focus on this issue. We encourage RFMOs to expand and improve their FAD management plans. Under appropriate management regimes, FAD fishing could be an ecologically and economically sensible fishing method.},

  abstract = {Fishers have intensively used drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) over the last three decades to facilitate their catch of tropical tunas. DFADs increase purse-­seine efficiency, potentially increasing tuna fishing mortality. They could also have impacts on tuna natural mortality and reproductive potential, and assessing the consequences of their presence at sea on tuna populations is a challenge. The use of DFADs results in a major increase in the number of floating objects, which are spatially heterogeneous at sea. To date, no converging scientific results exist regarding the effects of DFADs on the large-­scale movements and behaviour of tuna, mainly due to the difficulty of disentangling the respective roles of DFADs and environmental factors. Some biological indices show that tuna condition is lower when associated to a floating object than in a free-­swimming school. However, it is not clear whether this is the cause or the consequence of the association nor if it has long-­term effects on individuals' fitness. Further scientific progress requires (i) the collection of time series of indicators to monitor habitat change, individual behaviour, individual fitness, and population dynamics and (ii) experimental studies to identify the underlying behavioural and biological processes involved in associative behaviour. The extent of the modification of the surface habitat by the massive deployment of DFADs and the current uncertainty of the possible long-­term consequences on the individual fitness and dynamics of tuna populations argue for the need for increased awareness of this issue by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations regulating tuna fishing.},

  abstract = {The presence of abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gears, including drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs), in marine ecosystems poses significant ecological and socioeconomic concerns. The estimation of the number of dFADs in the marine environment is challenging due to the loss of tracking information when dFAD tracking buoys are remotely deactivated. For the first time, a data set of dFADs buoy positions, including those that had previously been remotely deactivated, has been made available for the period July–August 2020. Data from this period provide valuable insights into the life expectancy, spatial distribution, and status of deactivated dFAD buoys, enabling a more accurate assessment of dFAD presence and impacts. Deactivated buoys represented a 17.2\% increase in the total number of tracked objects, and we estimate the in-water half-life of deactivated dFAD tracking buoys to be 101 days. Including deactivated buoys increases the number of strandings during the SP by 23.7\%. Nevertheless, the representativity of these results is unknown given the limited spatio-temporal and numerical extent of our data, highlighting the importance of availability of comprehensive data on dFADs to effectively estimate their total numbers and mitigate their environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {Drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs) are human-­made floating objects widely used by tropical tuna purse seine (PS) fisheries to increase catch of target species. However, dFAD use has several negative impacts, including increased potential for overfishing, higher juvenile tuna catch, higher bycatch compared to other PS fishing modes, ghost-­fishing, and generation of marine litter. Based on these impacts, some stakeholders, especially environmental non-­governmental organizations and other competing fishing industries, suggest that dFADs should be completely banned. We list the pros and cons of dFAD fishing; address how to improve current management; and suggest solutions for the sustainability of dFAD fishing in the long term. A dFAD ban would lead to major changes in the availability and sourcing of tuna for human consumption and decrease the licensing revenue received by many developing states. Most importantly, we argue that tools exist today to manage for, reduce or eliminate most of the negative impacts of dFADs (e.g., bans on discards, limits on active dFADs, biodegradable non-­entangling constructions, time-­area deployment closures, recovery programs, and full data transparency, among others). Management decisions based on sound scientific reasoning are needed to address the legitimate concerns surrounding dFAD use and ensure the sustainability of both pelagic and coastal ecosystems and tropical tuna PS fisheries.},

  abstract = {Numerous pelagic species are known to associate with floating objects (FOBs), including tropical tunas. Purse seiners use this behaviour to facilitate the capture of tropical tunas by deploying artificial drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs). One major recent change has been the integration of echosounders in satellite-tracked GPS buoys attached to FOBs, allowing fishers to remotely estimate fishable biomass. Understanding the effects of this new technology on catch of the three main tuna species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares; bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus; and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis) is important to accurately correct for this change in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used for stock assessments. We analysed catch data from the French purse seine fleet for the period 2010–2017 in the Indian Ocean to assess the impact of this fleet’s switch to echosounder buoys around 2012. Results indicate that echosounders do not increase the probability a set will be succesful, but they have a positive effect on catch per set, with catches on average increasing by \%2 À 2:5 tonnes per set (\%10\%) when made on the vessel’s own dFADs equipped with an echosounder buoy. Increases were due to a decrease in sets below \%25 tonnes and an increase in those greater than \%25 tonnes, with a non-linear transition around this threshold. This increase explains the considerable investment of purse seiners in echosounder buoys, but also raises concerns about bias in stock size estimates based on CPUE if we do not correct for this fishing efficiency increase.},
