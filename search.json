    "text": "EN\nMy full name is Luis Wencheng Lau-Medrano, I am Peruvian by birth and a passionate (geek) about technology, marine biology, data analysis, Legos and travel. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the digital world and biology, so when I became an adult, I decided to combine both passions to solve problems and improve people’s lives (and my own, which I am working on).\nIn my professional career, I complete my bachelor as biologist with a specialization in Hydrobiology at the UNMSM (Lima-Peru), then I continued with a Master’s degree in Marine Sciences at the UPCH (Lima-Peru). Currently, I am finishing a doctorate in ecology at the University of Montpellier-UM (France) with an IRD scholarship.\nI have worked as a researcher at the Instituto del Mar del Perú-IMARPE, in the General Directorate of Pelagic Resources Research and in the General Directorate of Demersal and Littoral Resources Research. My main tasks were the statistical analysis of fishery information and research cruises for decision-making and management of the anchovy (Engraulis ringens), jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), mackerel (Scomber japonicus), hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus) and giant squid (Dosidicus gigas). Additionally, I have done two internships: one at the University of Washington-UW for the standardization of the CPUE of two shark species using the VAST tool, and another at the UM supporting the calibration of the OSMOSE model for the Peruvian Upwelling Ecosystem. I have experience as a speaker at international congresses held in Lima-Peru, La Paz-Mexico, Victoria-Canada and Palma de Mallorca-Spain.\nI have also experience teaching programming and data management courses and I am the creator and developer of the packages in CRAN imagine and grec.\nHobbies? Of course! Video games, building Legos, biking, traveling, taking pictures of natural and urban landscapes and programming (yes, also as a hobbie).\n\n\nES\nMi nombre completo es Luis Wencheng Lau-Medrano, soy peruano de nacimiento y un apasionado de la tecnología (un geek quizás), la biología marina, el análisis de datos, los Legos y los viajes. Desde siempre me ha fascinado el mundo digital y la biología, por lo que llegado el momento de ser adulto decidí combinar ambas pasiones para resolver problemas y mejorar la vida de las personas (y la mía propia, en ello trabajo).\nMi formación profesional inicial es de biólogo con mención en Hidrobiología en la UNMSM (Lima-Perú), luego continué con una Maestría en Ciencias del Mar en la UPCH (Lima-Perú). Actualmente, vengo finalizando un doctorado en ecología en la Universidad de Montpellier-UM (Francia) con el apoyo de una beca IRD.\nHe trabajado como investigador en el Instituto del Mar del Perú-IMARPE, en la Dirección General de Investigaciones de Recursos Pelágicos y en la Dirección General de Investigaciones de Recursos Demersales y Litorales. Mis labores principales fueron el análisis estadístico de información de pesquería y cruceros de investigación para la toma de decisiones y manejo de los recursos anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), jurel (Trachurus murphyi), caballa (Scomber japonicus), merluza (Merluccius gayi peruanus) y pota (Dosidicus gigas). Adicionalmente, he realizado dos pasantías: una en la Universidad de Washington-UW para la estandarización de la CPUE de dos especies de tiburones usando la herramienta VAST, y otra en la UM apoyando con la calibración del modelo OSMOSE para el Ecosistema de Afloramiento Peruano. Tengo experiencia como expositor en congresos internacionales realizados en Lima-Perú, La Paz-México, Victoria-Canadá y Palma de Mayorca-España.\nTambién tengo experiencia docente cursos de programación y manejo de datos y soy creador y desarrollador de los paquetes en CRAN imagine y grec.\n¿Hobbies? ¡Por supuesto! Juegos de video, armar Legos, pasear en bicicleta, viajar, tomar fotos de paisajes naturales y urbanos y programar (sí, también como hobbie)."

    "text": "The first thing that came to mind was “how can I develop a page that I can leave as a reference for those who want to contact me in a professional setting?” and “through what medium can I share those ideas, small works or personal experiences that I believe could be useful for other professionals in my field?”. Well, there are many options around (social media, podcasts, TikTok, etc.). This first decision was not difficult, as I am not particularly characterized by my charisma on social networks, so I decided to opt for writing a blog. However, here the decision-making process did get a bit complicated, as there are many platforms available: Wordpress, Netlify, Gitlab pages, Medium, among others. Each one offers different advantages and potential, but my decision was based above all on the familiarity of use of the Github and Quarto platforms. I decided on Github pages.\n\n\n\nGithub Pages is a free static website hosting service that allows you to publish HTML content directly from a GitHub repository. This platform offers multiple advantages:\n\nIt’s free!: You don’t need to pay for a web hosting service, just have a (free) GitHub account.\nEasy to use: Uploading your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to GitHub is very simple.\nDirect integration with GitHub: This becomes VERY important if you already use GitHub (as was my case) for your code projects.\nVersioning: GitHub Pages keeps a history of all the changes you make to your website, so if something goes wrong you can always go back to a previous version of your repository (page).\nSecure: GitHub Pages uses HTTPS to protect your website.\nFast: For a few years now, Microsoft has bought GitHub and therefore its services use an extensive global network of servers to deliver your website to users around the world.\nScalable: GitHub Pages can handle any amount of traffic, so your website can grow smoothly. Although a personal/professional blog is not expected to have very high traffic peaks, it is always good to know that this support exists.\nSEO optimized: GitHub Pages is optimized for search engines, which will help your website appear in the results of major web search engines.\n\nIn the end, Github pages was the hosting option that I found most attractive. However, there are multiple ways to upload content, from different development platforms that involve the use of programming languages (e.g. Javascript) or markup, such as markdown or Quarto. Once again, my historical experience weighed more and I decided to use Quarto.\n\n\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific document publishing platform developed by the POSIT (formerly RStudio) team. It is based on the R Markdown format and extends it with new features and functionalities to create richer and more interactive documents. It implements a more powerful preprocessing system than R Markdown and supports additional programming languages such as Python and Julia, expanding the possibilities for analysis and visualization.\nFor the past few years, I have been using Quarto not only for writing simple R reports, but also for the complete composition of scientific articles (one of them with a format submitted directly from the .docx output obtained in Quarto), as well as the development of interactive websites through the Quarto-Shiny duo.\n\n\n\nI Didn’t Have to Start from Scratch. Fortunately, there are many resources available online, but I will briefly summarize the main links I used:\n\nCreate the website hosted on Github pages, prepare it for content management with Quarto and to work from RStudio: The first steps to follow are very well explained in the video by Melissa Van Bussel (link). Highly recommended, although it assumes that we know how to handle Git-bash and that we have a token well configured for our PC. I will put these last details at the end of this article.\n\n\n\nEstablish an outline of what we are going to publish: Once we have successfully configured our website, it is time to take pen and paper and outline what content we want to share and what the logic will be for organizing that content into sections. While this part is very personal, since it will not be the same to diagram a page that only aims to serve as a professional reference (that is, an interactive resume) to that of a freelancer who wants to show their main projects and/or services offered, you don’t need to start from scratch either. You can review examples of pages from other creators (researchers, reporters, bloggers, graphic artists, etc.) and be inspired by their designs. Also, you can review examples of page structures that use Github pages (link). Remember, everything must ALWAYS start with the type of content you plan to place.\nStart writing: OK, this is not a scientific article and there is much more freedom to fill in the different sections; however, always remember to take into account the basic writing criteria (from general to specific), be clear and careful when choosing the type of language (based on the type of audience you expect to read you) and, once again, review examples. Of course, these days AI text generation platforms can be of great help, but we should not delegate the entire burden (i.e. no copy-paste) to them without first reading and corroborating the information they return to us. At this point, the following articles were very useful to me:\n\nCreate your website with Quarto: complete tutorial and template link: https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/.\nCreating your personal website with Quarto link: https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/.\nCreating a website link: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/.\n\nEstablish an order: Once we have finished and published a first article, everything will be simpler in technical terms since you will discover that there are multiple reference sources available."

Aunque de un blog personal/profesional no se espera tener picos de tráfico muy altos, siempre es bueno saber que existe este respaldo.\nOptimizado para SEO: GitHub Pages está optimizado para los motores de búsqueda, lo que ayudará a que nuestro sitio web aparezca en los resultados de los principales buscadores web.\n\nAl final, Github pages fue la opción de alojamiento que me resultó más atractiva. Sin embargo, existen múltiples maneras de subir contenido, desde diferentes plataformas de desarrollo que involucran el uso de lenguajes de programación (e.g. Javascript) o de marcado, como markdown o Quarto.

Afortunadamente, hay mucho material allá afuera, pero resumiré brevemente los principales links que utilicé:\n\nCrear la website alojada en Github pages, preparaela para el manejo de contenido con Quarto y para trabajar desde RStudio: Los primeros pasos a seguir están muy bien explicados en el vídeo de Melissa Van Bussel (link). Muy recomendable, aunque parte bajo el supuesto de que conocemos cómo manejar Git-bash y de que tenemos bien configurado un token para nuestra PC. Estos últimos detalles los colocaré al final de este artículo.\n\n\n\nEstablecer un esquema de lo que vamos a publicar. Una vez que hayamos logrado configurar correctamente nuestra web, sigue el turno de tomar lápiz y papel y esquematizar qué contenido deseamos compartir y cuál será la lógica para ordenar dicho contenido en secciones. Si bien esta parte es muy personal, ya que no será lo mismo diagramar una página que solo tiene como objetivo servir de referencia profesional (es decir, un CV interactivo) a la de un freelancer que desea mostrar sus principales proyectos y/o servicios ofrecidos, no necesitas ir desde cero tampoco. Puedes revisar ejemplos de páginas de otros creadores (investigadores, reporteros, bloggers, artistas gráficos, etc.) e inspirarte en sus diseños. Así también, puedes revisar ejemplos de estructuras de páginas que usan Github pages (link). Recuerda, todo debe partir SIEMPRE del tipo de contenido que planeas colocar.\nEmpezar a escribir. OK, esto no es un artículo científico y hay mucha más libertad para rellenar las distintas secciones; no obstante, recuerda siempre tener en cuenta los criterios básicos de redacción (de lo general a lo específico), ser claro y cuidadoso al elegir el tipo de lenguaje (con base en el tipo de público que esperas que te lea) y, una vez más, revisar ejemplos. Por supuesto, en estos días las plataformas de IA para generación de texto pueden resultar de gran ayuda, pero no debemos delegarles toda la carga (i.e. nada de copiar-pegar) sin antes leer corroborar la información que nos devuelven. En este punto, me fueron de mucha utilidad los siguientes artículos:\n\nCrear tu website con Quarto: tutorial completo y plantilla link.\nCreando tu website personal con Quarto link.\nCreando un website link.\n\nEstablecer un orden. Una vez que hayamos culminado y publicado un primer artículo, todo irá siendo más simple en términos técnicos ya que descubrirás que existen múltiples fuentes de referencia disponibles."
